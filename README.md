## Overview
I used CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox to tackle this problem today because I'm still learning how to combine these two. Flex-box for inner components and a grid for the outside ones Adding an overlay to a picture was challenging for me, but I managed to do it by using CSS instead of an HTML img. I hope you'll find my answer useful. If I erred, kindly point it out. I arrived here to study.

- Put image overlay using css
